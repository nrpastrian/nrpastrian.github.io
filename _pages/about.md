Hi! I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.econ.pitt.edu/). I'm a microeconomic theorist working on mechanism design and market design. My research focuses on problems with asymmetric information and boundedly rational agents, with applications in Industrial Organization and Public Economics.

I hold a BA in Economics and Business and an MA in Economics from [Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile](https://economia.uc.cl/). 

I'm on the 2023-2024 job market!

## Research
Working papers:
* Product Line Design with Frictions. [[Paper]](https://nrpastrian.github.io/files/pastrian_jmp.pdf)
  <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
  <p>We study a monopolist's product line design problem with search frictions. Consumers only evaluate a random subset of price-quality pairs in the menu, limiting the monopolist's ability to perfectly match contracts to consumer types. This creates a tradeoff faced when expanding the product line between extracting more rents from different consumer types and increased search costs. We show that when consumers are limited to seeing a single random contract out of the menu, then the optimal menu for the monopolist always contains a single offer. When consumers observe more than one offer, we show that a balanced menu with two contracts that are seen by a consumer with the same probability is never optimal. The monopolist rather has an incentive to "bias" the menu so that one of the offers is observed more often. Using an unbalanced menu has an impact on the quality provided to low valuation consumers, either reinforcing or reducing the distortions generated by asymmetric information. We discuss the consequences on quality provision, as well as the welfare effects of these distortions.</p></details>

* Full Surplus Extraction and Consideration Sets. [[Paper]](https://nrpastrian.github.io/files/full_surplus_extraction_consideration_sets.pdf)
  <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
  <p>We examine the surplus extraction problem in a mechanism design setting with consideration sets. We model consideration sets as the subset of types a particular type considers as possible deviations. Our model is built upon a discrete version of the reduced mechanism design problem in McAfee and Reny (1992), and the partially verifiable types in Green and Laffont (1986) for the modeling of consideration sets. We identify the inverse consideration sets as the key elements to determine whether full surplus extraction is feasible or not, and characterize the conditions that guarantee full surplus extraction to be feasible in this setting. We show that the independence condition identified by Cremer and McLean (1988) remains sufficient for full surplus extraction in our setting but could be relaxed to obtain a more general characterization. Finally, we discuss some applications and limitations of our model.</p></details>
