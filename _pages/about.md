Hi! I'm a PhD student in Economics at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.econ.pitt.edu/). I'm a microeconomic theorist working on mechanism design, industrial organization and political economy.

I hold a BA and an MA in Economics from [Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile](https://economia.uc.cl/).
